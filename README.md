# react-roster
 Express + React app Roster for 7cav.us

## TODO:

- [ ] Reorganize this terribleness into something more streamlined
- [ ] Wait for jarvis to update the API so that sort order is properly displayed
- [ ] Look into sorting by rank after sorting by billet (Subsorting? QuickSort maybe?)
- [x] Maybe a loading screen?
- [ ] General Code Cleanup
- [ ] Fix these fucking errors that throw up over list keys
