# 7th Cavalry ADR

A react app intended to display roster data from the 7th Cavalry API.

## TODO:

- [ ] Wait for jarvis to update the API so that sort order is properly displayed
- [ ] Look into sorting by rank after sorting by billet (Subsorting? QuickSort maybe?)
- [ ] Implement a sort of graph for easier data visualization
