# 7th Cavalry ADR
[![ADR_PUSH](https://github.com/7Cav/adr/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/7Cav/adr/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A react app intended to display roster data from the 7th Cavalry API.

## TODO:

- [ ] Wait for jarvis to update the API so that sort order is properly displayed
- [ ] Look into sorting by rank after sorting by billet (Subsorting? QuickSort maybe?)
- [ ] Implement a sort of graph for easier data visualization
